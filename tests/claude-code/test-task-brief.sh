## Task Structure

### Task 1: Alpha

Alpha body.

#### Step 1.1

```bash
# Task 2: this heading lives inside a fence
## Global Constraints inside a fence
```

Alpha tail.

### Task 2: Beta

Beta body.

### Task 10: Gamma

Gamma body.

## Self-Review

Trailing section that belongs to the plan, not to Task 10.
