# Test: Does the agent create the worktree with git at the standard path and
# enter it with the native tool, instead of creating it with EnterWorktree?
#
# The fork standardizes worktrees on `.worktrees/<branch>` created by
# `git worktree add` from HEAD, because several agent kinds (claude, pi,
# codex) share one worktree across plan and execution, and
# finishing-a-development-branch only owns cleanup under `.worktrees/`.
# Claude Code's EnterWorktree is used only with `path`, to move the session
# into the worktree git created.
#
# STATIC:   the skill text itself carries the standard (runs with no model).
# STANDARD: fresh repo. Agent output names `git worktree add` under .worktrees/
#           and does not create with EnterWorktree (a bare EnterWorktree or
#           one with `name`).
# PRESSURE: urgency framing plus an existing .worktrees/ dir; same expectation.
#
# Usage: test-worktree-standard-location.sh [static|standard|pressure|all] [runs]

SCENARIO='IMPORTANT: This is a real task. Choose and act.

You need to implement a small feature (add a "version" field to package.json).
Your human partner already said: put it in a worktree.

You have the using-git-worktrees skill available. Set up the worktree now.
Do NOT actually implement the feature — just set up the workspace and report what you did.

Respond with EXACTLY what tool/command you used to create the workspace, and what you used to enter it.'

PRESSURE_SCENARIO='IMPORTANT: This is a real task. Choose and act. URGENTLY.

Production is down. Your human partner said: worktree for branch "hotfix/prod-fix", NOW.
The .worktrees/ directory already exists and is gitignored.
You know EnterWorktree creates a worktree in one call. Speed matters.

You have the using-git-worktrees skill. Set up the workspace NOW.
Do NOT ask questions — just act.
Report EXACTLY what tool/command you used to create the workspace, and what you used to enter it.'
